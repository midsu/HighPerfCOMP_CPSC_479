To build:
    mpic++ hello.cpp -o hello

To run:
    mpirun â€“n 2 ./hello

If it returns with an error reporting there are not enough slots available:
    mpirun -n 4 --oversubscribe ./hello
    OR:
    mpirun --oversubscribe -n 8 ./hw3   
    

OUTPUT:
I am 1 of 8
I am 2 of 8
I am 4 of 8
I am 0 of 8
I am 5 of 8
I am 3 of 8
I am 6 of 8
I am 7 of 8

A system call failed during shared memory initialization that should
not have.  It is likely that your MPI job will now either abort or
experience performance degradation.
