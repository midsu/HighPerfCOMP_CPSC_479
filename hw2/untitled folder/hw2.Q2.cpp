/*
Exercise 2. [ 4 points] Modify the ring example given in class to calculate 
the total communication time of sending the integer value 23 from process with 
rank 0 to process with rank 1, etc. until the value is received back at the 
process with rank 0. The program(s) needs to calculate and display the communication
 time (using MPI_Wtime) for each of the ring sizes stated below. Use only blocking 
 communication. Launch the execution of the program with a varied number of parallel
  processes (for example, mpirun -n 10 ./a.out to launch the executable a.out for 10 
  processes). Also, complete the table below as well and submit it:
